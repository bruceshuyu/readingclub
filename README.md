# Reading Club

We are a reading club interested in topics related to programming languages (PL) and formal methods (FM).  Get together to read and discuss research papers that are interesting to us.  The goal is to learn and help each other learn.

#### Topics of interest
- programming languages (PL)
- formal methods (FM)
- the intersection of PL or FM with other areas, such as:
  - security; for example, information flow
  - machine learning; for example, ML for discovering program invariants
  - synthesis; for example, synthesis of programs from examples or specification

## Organization

### 1) Pick a paper

- We will decide on a paper together
  - Anyone can suggest a paper
  - Anyone can vote on a suggested paper
  - The most voted paper is selected for reading next
  - We will decide on a meeting day to discuss the selected paper.
  - If the paper you suggested is selected, you'll be asked to be the ```moderator``` (see below).

### 2) Meet

- Once a meeting day is set, we will get together in a conference room
  - Print and bring the selected paper, a pen and paper to take notes
  - Unless you have a specific reason, **please do not bring a laptop** or an electronic gadget
- We will read the selected paper together
  - **There is no need to have read the paper beforehand** (that is, unless you are the moderator)
  - If you are super interested or if you think it will help you keep up and contribute to the discussion, of course you are welcome to read the paper before the meeting.


### 3) Discuss!
- We will discuss while we read so,
  - bring your willingness to ask questions and
  - feel free to answer someone else's question 
- Meetings will last about one hour.  If we don't finish the paper before the end of the hour and people are still interested, we may choose to continue the discussion on the next meeting.


### If you are the moderator

If the paper your suggested was selected for discussion, then you are the ```moderator``` and you have a little bit of work to do.  Your job is to be somewhat familiar with the paper and to help contextualize the paper to the other participants.  So,

**Before the meeting**

You should attempt to read the paper before the meeting.
At least read the abstract and try to read the introduction and the conclusion.
Since you suggested this paper to the group, you should also be able to say why you chose this paper.  What makes it interesting or relevant?

It may be good to know some trivialities about the paper, for example:

- where was it published and when
- what field is it most associated with
- is it highly cited or is it more of a niche result?

**During the meeting**

- To get the meeting started, you may want to comment on what you found out from having skimmed through the paper before the meeting.
- You may be asked why you chose the paper, why you think it is interesting or relevant.  Be ready to answer that.
- Remember: just because you are the ```moderator``` it does not mean you need to be able to answer people's technical questions.  Specially if you are a junior person (like an entry level PhD student), you may not know many of the answers.  Feel free to let people discuss among each other.  People should not look up to you for precise answers, but if someone does that on accident, you can always deflect the question with another question like:

      *``can anyone contribute to answering Bob's question"?*

## Rules and advice

##### Participation is welcome!

Anyone who is interested is welcome.
We would like for folks to contribute to the discussion:
Ask a question if you have one.
Answer a question if you think you can help someone else learn.
Try to engage.

##### Participation is voluntary

The willingness to participate should come from you.
There should no negative consequence to skipping meetings and not participating.
Advisers should not require their students to participate.
You should decide for yourself and your decision should be respected.

#####  Every question is a valid question

We will treat each other and each other's questions with respect.
This is a safe environment for you to ask the technical questions you have been embarrassed to ask, or that you thought you should already know by now.  We ought not to judge each other, we ought to help each other.

##### Respect where you are

People are at different stages in their careers.
Don't worry about being behind.  Everyone feels behind at some point.
The important thing is not where you are today (in your pursuit of knowledge) but the progress you are making. Or, as a mathematician friend of mine used to say:

*what is important is not the $S_0$ but the $\Delta S$*

You will make more progress if you are gentle with yourself.  Don't waste energy beating yourself up and thinking you should be different.  It's better to spend that energy asking questions and learning.

##### People have different learning agendas

People have different interests and learning agendas.  It is normal for some to be more engaged than others.  Some topics are more interesting and relevant to you than others.  That is OK.  In either case, lets try to make an environment where there is something for everybody, from the expect to the beginner, from the aficionado to the casual observer.

##### You get what you put in


### Why should I participate?

I will participate because:

- I believe I'll learn something useful or interesting,
- the topic is closely related to my research,
- it will make me more well rounded, or,  I want to get a bigger picture,
- I could use some help: I've always wanted to learn the topic but I found the papers hard to read,
- I need a little motivation!
- I want to get practice discussing technical papers.

If you relate to some of the reasons above, please come!

### Reasons not to participate

It is really important to participate "for the right reasons."
That means it can also be important **not** to participate.  It is OK not to participate.  It is OK to skip a meeting.

Here are some example reasons not to participate:


*"I am think this meeting will be a waste of my time, but my someone else (my adviser?) thinks I should be here"*

```
Unless you are motivated, you are likely not to get much out of it.
You are also likely not to contribute, so it's best to skip the meeting.
